OVERVIEW

This workshop introduced me to UI/UX (User Interface and User Experience) fundamentals. Learnt to create user-friendly designs, explored industry-standard tools, and applied my skills by redesigning my favorite app, from an idea to a prototype in record time. Learnt the basics of UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) designâ€”where UI focuses on how things look and UX focuses on how they work to ensure a smooth and enjoyable user experience. Got hands-on experience with Figma, a popular design tool used worldwide. Redesigned an app,step by step and turned my ideas into a functional prototype quickly and effortlessly.
